# Lab 2: Set Covering with Genetic Algorithm
<p>
  For this problem I have implemented a very simple genetic algorith, that use for 50% mutations and for 50% crossover in 100 generations.
</p>
<p>
 I based my solution on the Code of the prof. Squillero found in https://github.com/squillero/computational-intelligence/blob/master/2022-23/one-max.ipynb.
 </P>
 <p>
  This solution works very fast instead of Dijkstra's algorithm but doesn't found  the best solution, anyway it can be run also with large N like 50, 100 in a reasonable time.
